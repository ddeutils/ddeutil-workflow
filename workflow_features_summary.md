# Workflow Pipeline Features Summary

## Analysis Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of the current workflow system and comparison with industry-standard workflow tools (Google Cloud Workflows, AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions), I've identified key missing features that would significantly enhance the workflow pipeline capabilities.

## Current Workflow System Strengths

The existing system provides a solid foundation with:

### Core Stages Available
1. **EmptyStage** - Logging and debugging

4. **VirtualPyStage** - Python in virtual environment
5. **CallStage** - Function calls with registry
6. **TriggerStage** - Workflow orchestration
7. **ParallelStage** - Concurrent execution
8. **ForEachStage** - Iterative processing
9. **CaseStage** - Conditional execution
10. **UntilStage** - Retry loops and polling

## Implemented High-Priority Features

I've successfully implemented the following high-priority stages:

### 1. TryCatchFinallyStage
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Robust Operation"
    try:
      - name: "Primary Operation"
        uses: "api/primary_method@latest"
    catch:
      - name: "Fallback Operation"
        uses: "api/fallback_method@latest"
    finally:
      - name: "Cleanup"
        uses: "utils/cleanup@latest"
```

**Features:**
- Structured error handling with try, catch, and finally blocks
- Configurable error type filtering
- Proper error propagation and context preservation
- Always executes finally block regardless of success/failure

### 2. WaitStage
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Wait for Resource"
    wait:
      seconds: 30
      # or
      until: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      # or
      for: "${{ params.resource_ready }}"
```

**Features:**
- Duration-based waiting
- DateTime-based waiting (ISO format)
- Condition-based waiting with polling
- Configurable check intervals and timeouts
- Async support for non-blocking execution

### 3. HttpStage
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "API Call"
    http:
      method: "POST"
      url: "https://api.example.com/data"
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${{ params.token }}"
      body: "${{ params.data }}"
      timeout: 30
      retry: 3
```

**Features:**
- Full HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Header and body configuration
- SSL verification control
- Redirect handling
- Retry capabilities with exponential backoff
- Both sync and async implementations

### 4. SetVariableStage
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Set Context Variables"
    set:
      processed_count: "${{ params.count }}"
      last_processed: "${{ params.item }}"
      status: "completed"
```

**Features:**
- Template parameter resolution
- Context variable management
- Integration with workflow state

### 5. GetVariableStage
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Get Context Variables"
    get:
      variables: ["processed_count", "last_processed"]
      default: "0"
```

**Features:**
- Variable retrieval from context
- Default value support
- Multiple variable extraction

## Technical Implementation Details

### Stage Inheritance
All new stages follow the established inheritance patterns:
- `BaseStage` for simple stages
- `BaseAsyncStage` for async-capable stages
- `BaseRetryStage` for stages with retry capabilities
- `BaseNestedStage` for stages containing other stages

### Error Handling
- Consistent error handling across all stages
- Proper error propagation and context preservation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Event-driven cancellation support

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient resource management
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Async support for non-blocking operations

### Configuration
- Environment variable support
- Template parameter resolution
- Extensible configuration system
- Validation with Pydantic models

## Usage Examples

### Robust API Integration
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "API Integration"
    try:
      - name: "Primary API Call"
        http:
          method: "POST"
          url: "${{ params.api_url }}"
          body: "${{ params.data }}"
    catch:
      - name: "Fallback API Call"
        http:
          method: "POST"
          url: "${{ params.fallback_url }}"
          body: "${{ params.data }}"
    finally:
      - name: "Log Result"
        echo: "API call completed"
```

### Conditional Processing with State
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Set Initial State"
    set:
      processed_count: 0
      status: "processing"

  - name: "Process Items"
    foreach: "${{ params.items }}"
    stages:
      - name: "Process Item"
        uses: "processing/worker@latest"
        with:
          item: "${{ item }}"

      - name: "Update Count"
        set:
          processed_count: "${{ processed_count + 1 }}"

  - name: "Finalize"
    set:
      status: "completed"
```

### Resource Waiting
```yaml
stages:
  - name: "Wait for Database"
    wait:
      for: "${{ params.db_ready }}"
      check-interval: 5
      max-wait: 300

  - name: "Database Operation"
    uses: "database/operation@latest"
```

The focus on error handling, external integration, and state management addresses the most critical gaps in the current system.

The modular design allows for gradual adoption of new features without disrupting existing workflows, while the consistent API patterns ensure ease of use and maintainability.
