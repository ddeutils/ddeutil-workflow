The **Lightweight Workflow Orchestration** with fewer dependencies the was created
for easy to make a simple metadata driven data workflow. It can use for data operator
by a `.yaml` template.

In my opinion, I think it should not create duplicate workflow codes if I can
write with dynamic input parameters on the one template workflow that just change
the input parameters per use-case instead.
This way I can handle a lot of logical workflows in our orgs with only metadata
configuration. It called **Metadata Driven Data Workflow**.

**:pushpin: <u>Rules of This Workflow engine</u>**:

1. The Minimum frequency unit of built-in scheduling is **1 Minute** 🕘
2. **Can not** re-run only failed stage and its pending downstream ↩️
3. All parallel tasks inside workflow core engine use **Multi-Threading** pool
   (Python 3.13 unlock GIL 🐍🔓)

**:memo: <u>Workflow Diagrams</u>**:

This diagram show where is this application run on the production infrastructure.
You will see that this application do only running code with stress-less which mean
you should to set the data layer separate this core program before run this application.

## 📦 Installation

This project need `ddeutil` and `ddeutil-io` extension namespace packages.
If you want to install this package with application add-ons, you should add
`app` in installation;

## :beers: Usage

This is examples that use workflow file for running common Data Engineering
use-case.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I recommend you to use the `call` stage for all actions that you want to do
> with workflow activity that you want to orchestrate. Because it is able to
> dynamic an input argument with the same call function that make you use less
> time to maintenance your data workflows.

```yaml
run-py-local:

   # Validate model that use to parsing exists for template file
   type: Workflow
   on:
      # If workflow deploy to schedule, it will run every 5 minutes
      # with Asia/Bangkok timezone.
      - cronjob: '*/5 * * * *'
        timezone: "Asia/Bangkok"
   params:
      # Incoming execution parameters will validate with this type. It allows
      # to set default value or templating.
      source-extract: str
      run-date: datetime
   jobs:
      getting-api-data:
         runs-on:
            type: local
         stages:
            - name: "Retrieve API Data"
              id: retrieve-api
              uses: tasks/get-api-with-oauth-to-s3@requests
              with:
                 # Arguments of source data that want to retrieve.
                 method: post
                 url: https://finances/open-data/currency-pairs/
                 body:
                    resource: ${{ params.source-extract }}

                    # You can use filtering like Jinja template but this
                    # package does not use it.
                    filter: ${{ params.run-date | fmt(fmt='%Y%m%d') }}
                 auth:
                    type: bearer
                    keys: ${API_ACCESS_REFRESH_TOKEN}

                 # Arguments of target data that want to land.
                 writing_mode: flatten
                 aws_s3_path: my-data/open-data/${{ params.source-extract }}

                 # This Authentication code should implement with your custom call
                 # function. The template allow you to use environment variable.
                 aws_access_client_id: ${AWS_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID}
                 aws_access_client_secret: ${AWS_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

The above workflow template is main executor pipeline that you want to do. If you
want to schedule this workflow, you want to dynamic its parameters change base on
execution time such as `run-date` should change base on that workflow running date.

```python
from ddeutil.workflow import Workflow, Result

workflow: Workflow = Workflow.from_conf('run-py-local')
result: Result = workflow.execute(
   params={"source-extract": "USD-THB", "asat-dt": "2024-01-01"}
)
```

So, this package provide the `Schedule` template for this action, and you can dynamic
pass the parameters for changing align with that running time by the `release` prefix.

```yaml
schedule-run-local-wf:

   # Validate model that use to parsing exists for template file
   type: Schedule
   workflows:

      # Map existing workflow that want to deploy with scheduler application.
      # It allows you to pass release parameter that dynamic change depend on the
      # current context of this scheduler application releasing that time.
      - name: run-py-local
        params:
          source-extract: "USD-THB"
          asat-dt: "${{ release.logical_date }}"
```

The main method of the `Schedule` model that use to running is `pending`. If you
do not pass the `stop` date on this method, it will use config with `WORKFLOW_APP_STOP_BOUNDARY_DELTA`
key for generate this stop date.

```python
from ddeutil.workflow import Schedule

(
   Schedule
   .from_conf("schedule-run-local-wf")
   .pending(stop=None)
)
```

## :cookie: Configuration

The main configuration that use to dynamic changing this workflow engine for your
objective use environment variable only. If any configuration values do not set yet,
it will use default value and do not raise any error to you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The config value that you will set on the environment should combine with
> prefix, component, and name which is `WORKFLOW_{component}_{name}` (Upper case).

## :rocket: Deployment

This package able to run as an application service for receive manual trigger
from the master node via RestAPI or use to be Scheduler background service
like crontab job but via Python API.

and you can create by your coding without this project dependency for long term

for fix bug or request new feature if you want it.
