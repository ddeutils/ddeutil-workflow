1. **Try-Catch-Finally Stage** - Essential for robust error handling
2. **Wait Stage** - Basic timing control
3. **HTTP Stage** - External API integration

2. **Database Stage** - Database operations
3. **Health Check Stage** - System monitoring
4. **Fan-Out/Fan-In Stage** - Complex parallel patterns
5. **Guard Stage** - Security controls

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Stage Inheritance
- All new stages should inherit from appropriate base classes
- Use `BaseRetryStage` for stages that need retry capability
- Use `BaseNestedStage` for stages that contain other stages

### 2. Error Handling
- Consistent error handling across all stages
- Proper error propagation and context preservation
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### 3. Performance
- Efficient resource management
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

### 4. Configuration
- Environment variable support
- Template parameter resolution
- Extensible configuration system

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for each stage
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Performance benchmarks for parallel stages

## Conclusion

The current workflow system provides a solid foundation with basic control flow and execution capabilities. However, adding these missing features would significantly enhance its power and flexibility, making it competitive with commercial workflow solutions while maintaining its lightweight and extensible architecture.

The implementation should focus on high-priority features first, ensuring robust error handling and external integration capabilities, then gradually add more advanced features based on user needs and feedback.
